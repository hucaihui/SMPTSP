A SAT Approach for SMPTSP
=========================

Our attempt to have efficient solutions for the Shift Minimisation Personnel
Task Scheduling Problem (SMPTSP)

see https://sites.google.com/site/ptsplib/smptsp/home for description, links
to papers and instances. 

In folder prototype you find ASP encodings (use Gringo and Clasp,
potassco.sourceforge.net) and in folder encoder you find a SAT translation
based on Bule (github.com/vale1410/bule).
